# Output Generated Files (Optional: keep if user wants data, but usually ignored in code repos)
# User request "createData" might imply they want the data? 
# "khởi tạo readme và up lên... createData.git"
# I will keep JSONs as seed/sample but ignore voluminous outputs if any.
# However, json files are re-generated. Let's ignore them to force generation?
# No, let's keep them as "current state" for reference unless they are huge. 
# They are ~300KB. OK to keep.
# The "output" folder contains pdf/docx. 
# I'll ignore output folder content BUT keep the folder structure if needed.
# Actually user wants "createData", maybe they want the RESULTS. 
# I will NOT ignore output files for now, as the user intention "createData" typically means sharing the data.
# But standard practice is ignoring artifacts.
# I will ignore `output/` but allow `long_data.json` (seed).
# generated_sample_data.json and generated_error_data.json are outputs of scripts.
# I'll act professional: Code repo should generate data, not store it (unless it's a dataset repo).
# I'll create a "releases" section in README instead?
# Let's Compromise: Ignore `output/` (PDFs/DOCX) because they are binary/large. Keep JSONs?
# I will ignore `output/` content but keep `.gitkeep` if I create one.
# For now, I will ignore `output/*.docx` and `output/*.pdf`.
